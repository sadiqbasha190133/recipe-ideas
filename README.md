ðŸ“„ Statement of Purpose (SOP) â€“ Recipe Finder App
## Objective

The primary objective of this project is to build an intelligent recipe discovery platform that dynamically fetches and presents meals based on a userâ€™s context â€” such as mood, preferred category, available time, or available ingredients. The application aims to provide an engaging, interactive, and personalized cooking assistant experience.

## Motivation

Choosing what to cook is often a frustrating task, especially when limited by time, ingredients, or indecision. Inspired by the idea of tailoring recipes to moods and constraints, this project was designed to simplify the decision-making process using multiple APIs, while also strengthening skills in frontend development, API integration, and state management in React.



Features Developed

1) Dynamic Recipe Search Modes

    ðŸ‘‰ Users can select how they want to discover meals:

    ðŸ‘‰ Random Meal

    ðŸ‘‰ Random 10 Meals

    ðŸ‘‰ Category-wise

    ðŸ‘‰ Area-wise (Cuisine-based)

    ðŸ‘‰ Ingredients-based

2) Dropdown Search Bar

    ðŸ‘‰ A unified search interface lets users choose their preferred mode, which dynamically updates the API endpoint.

3) API Integration

    ðŸ‘‰ Multiple endpoints integrated seamlessly (random_meal, random10_meals, categories, area, list_of_ingredients).

4) Conditional Rendering

    ðŸ‘‰ Results are displayed differently based on API data structure (handling both idMeal & idIngredient).

5) Error & Loading Handling

    ðŸ‘‰ Loading indicators while fetching data.

    ðŸ‘‰ Graceful error handling for network/API failures.

    ðŸ‘‰ Empty state messages when no recipes are found.

6) Reusable Components

    SearchBar for query handling.

    RecipeCard for displaying recipes uniformly.

    State-driven rendering in Home.jsx.

7) Technical Implementations

    Frontend: React.js

    State Management: React Hooks (useState, useEffect)

    API Calls: Fetch API with async/await

    Error Handling: Try/catch with descriptive messages

    Component Design: Modular & reusable

    UI Feedback: Loading spinners, error states, empty states
